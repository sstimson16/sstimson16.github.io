     Hello everyone! I’m Sami Stimson, and I’m from St. Louis, Missouri. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Finance and Banking in December 2024 and am currently working toward my MBA, graduating in December 2025. This summer, I’m interning in corporate finance at Schnucks, where I assist with budgeting, financial planning, and reporting. I’ll also be working part-time in the fall while finishing up classes. I’m brand new to web development. This is my first time learning anything like this. The first few activities were a bit confusing, but I’ve started to catch on, and I’m excited to continue. I’m especially looking forward to building a website from scratch and seeing what I can create by the end of the course. In my free time, I love trying out new restaurants and coffee shops, and I’m really into fashion and shopping.
