            This experience solidified my interest in real estate and strengthened my technical modeling and underwriting skills.
            I learned the importance of understanding market risk and gained confidence in analyzing deal structures and
            partnership terms. It also emphasized the importance of strategic alignment when evaluating investment opportunities.

          <p>
            During my internship at RGA, I supported the equity real estate investment team by conducting financial analysis
            for commercial real estate opportunities across multiple asset classes including industrial, multifamily, retail,
            and office. I evaluated deals ranging from $20 to $100 million and participated in underwriting joint venture
            investments. My responsibilities included analyzing market comps, researching economic trends, and building
            Excel models to project returns and evaluate alignment with RGA’s long-term investment goals. I worked closely
            with senior analysts to present findings and participate in investment committee discussions. This internship
            offered firsthand exposure to institutional real estate decision-making processes.

            At Maritz, I worked on the Edward Jones account, supporting event financial management for over 368 regional events.
            I processed 5–10 vendor payments per week, coordinated with suppliers, and ensured that contracts and invoices were properly tracked.
            I used macros in Excel to automate recurring reporting tasks and to compile weekly financial summaries for the accounting and planning teams.
            In addition to managing payments, I helped streamline the expense reporting process, making sure all financial records aligned with project budgets and event plans.
            This role required strong organization and close attention to detail in a fast-paced environment.

            This internship helped reinforce the foundational accounting concepts I learned in class and introduced me to working directly

            As an accounting intern, I enter daily financial transactions into QuickBooks, ensuring accurate and
            up-to-date financial records for small business clients. I also conduct monthly bank reconciliations to
            resolve discrepancies and provide clean financials. Working remotely, I’ve built strong time management
            skills and the ability to work independently while still communicating with clients and supervisors regularly.
            This role has given me practical experience with double-entry accounting, account reconciliation, and the general ledger.
            It’s also allowed me to learn how accounting supports broader business decision-making.
