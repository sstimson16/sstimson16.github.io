        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi! My name is Sami Stimson. I am from St. Louis, Missouri. I am a graduate student at the University of Missouri. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Finance and Banking in December 2024. I am currently completing my MBA and will graduate in December 2025.</p>
        <p>I recently started a year-round internship in corporate finance at Schnucks. I assist with budgeting, financial planning, and reporting. I’m only a week in, but I’m excited to learn more and gain hands-on experience. I look forward to building my skills in Excel, communication, and business analysis.</p>
        <p>I’m exploring various areas within finance to determine where I thrive the most. I hope to grow in a role that combines strategy, collaboration, and continuous learning. After graduation, I plan to return to St. Louis to start my career.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new restaurants. I also visit coffee shops and follow fashion trends. I believe personal style and creative spaces reflect confidence and curiosity.This website shares my experience, goals, and professional journey. I hope you enjoy learning more about me and my work.</p>
